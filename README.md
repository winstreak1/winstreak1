- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @winstreak1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, C++, Java, C#, algorithmic options trading with consideration to time complexity, the thread and latency preparation using VPC's.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning artificial intelligence (neural networks, LSTM, word-to-vec, generative, genetic algorithm, backtracking a-star, bfs, dfs, pipelining, Jupyter Notebook, pycharm, Google Collab, etc.)
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Algorithmic trading strategies, options data structures (hashmap, dictionary, etc.) through code that minimize latency
